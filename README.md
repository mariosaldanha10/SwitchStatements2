# SwitchStatements2

This is a C# program that prompts the user to enter a student's roll number and then uses a switch statement to display the student's name and age based on the roll number entered. If the entered roll number is not found in the switch statement, it displays "No student found." Here's how the program works:

The program prompts the user to enter a student's roll number using the Console.Write and Console.ReadLine methods.

The entered roll number is stored in an integer variable called RollNo using the Convert.ToInt32 method.

The switch statement is used to compare the entered roll number with the cases listed. If a case matches the entered roll number, the code block following that case is executed.

The program displays the name and age of the student corresponding to the entered roll number using the Console.WriteLine method.

If the entered roll number does not match any of the cases listed, the default case is executed and the program displays "No student found."
